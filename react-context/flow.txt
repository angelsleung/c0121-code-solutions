1) User can sign up:
- User clicks the "Register now" link which triggers the hashchange event and updates the route property of the state, which changes the text on the page to reflect the Sign-up page.
- User inputs a username and password and clicks Register
- When the submit event is triggered, the client sends a POST fetch request to the server
- Server checks to see if username and password are filled in, hashes the password, then sends a SQL query to the database to create a new login
- The server returns a status code indicating the success/failure of the request, along with the newly created login in the case of success

2) User can sign in:
- User inputs username and password and clicks Log In
- When the submit event is triggered, the client sends a POST fetch request to the server
- Server checks to see if username and password are filled in, then sends a SQL query to the database
- If the username exists in the database, the server hashes the provided password and compares it with the hashed password from the database
- If the hashed passwords match, the server generates a JSON web token with the login information and sends it to the client
- If a token is provided, the user is able to log in successfully
- This triggers a hashchange event that updates the user property of the state, and this leads to a re-render of the page
- The user is navigated to Home page and is able to see the Rick Roll gif

3) User can stay signed in (even if they refresh the page):
- When the app loads, the browser checks local storage to see if there is a token saved under 'react-context-jwt'
- If there is a token, the browser decodes the token to get the payload and updates the user property of the state to be the user, so they do not have to log in again
- Otherwise, the user is navigated to the Auth sign-up page

4) User can sign out:
- When the user clicks the Sign Out button, the token is removed from local storage
- A hashchange event is triggered and the user property of the state is cleared
- This leads to a re-render of the page, and the user sees the Auth sign-up page again
